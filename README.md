# firebase-python
Connect to Firebase Realtime Database, and execute CRUD operations.

## Setup

Refer to [Python Firebase](https://ozgur.github.io/python-firebase/)

    $ pip install requests
    $ pip install python-firebase

**Had some trouble to get it work under `Python 3.7`. It works with `Python 3.6`.**



## To Run

Put the following in `firebase_profile.py`:
```Python
FIREBASE_URL = "https://YOUR-APP-NAME.firebaseio.com"
```
